===========

This project is to create an interactive, 3D navigable map of all known objects in our galaxy cross-referenced against IAF, NASA, and other similar object databases, as well as Wikipedia and systems like WolframAlpha. I suspect this will be mostly data. Think the navigation system in Mass Effect meets voyager's Astrometrics lab. Hell, it might even end up as something that's actually useful, instead of me just satisfying my own geeky curiosity. :p
