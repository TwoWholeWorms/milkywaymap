milkywaymap
===========

This project is to create an interactive, 3d navigable map of all known objects in the Milky Way galaxy which is cross-referenced against IAF, NASA, and other similar object databases, as well as Wikipedia and systems like WolframAlpha. Think the navigation system in Mass Effect meets voyager's Astrometrics lab. Hell, it might even end up as something that's actually useful. :p
